   scp  account.ring.gz container.ring.gz object.ring.gz  <username>@<IP>:/etc/swift

1. if you want a node run storage only 
   Start:
   sudo ./proxy
   #username and ip is the every node in the cluster
   
   sudo ./start_storage

   Stop:
   sudo ./stop_storage

   Remove:

   #username and ip is the every node in the cluster
   ./start_proxy

   Stop:

   Remove:
   ./rm_proxy

3. if you want a node run both proxy and storage service
