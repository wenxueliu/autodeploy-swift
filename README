1)you create ring, the ip is only storage ip.
   sudo ./ring 
2)you should scp the ring files to all node under /etc/swift directory. wether storage node or proxy node.
   scp  account.ring.gz container.ring.gz object.ring.gz  <username>@<IP>:/etc/swift

1. if you want a node run storage only 
   Start:
   sudo ./storage
   #username and ip is the every node in the cluster
   
   sudo ./start_storage

   Stop:
   sudo ./stop_storage

   Remove:
   sudo ./rm_storage

2. if you want a node run only proxy
   Start:
   #as some bugs about cffi, you have to install proxy two times
   sudo ./proxy
   sudo ./start_proxy
   #username and ip is the every node in the cluster

   Stop:
   sudo ./stop_proxy

   Remove:
   sudo ./rm_proxy

3. if you want a node run both proxy and storage service # haven't test
